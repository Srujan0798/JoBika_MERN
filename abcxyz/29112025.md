## # Summary
**Objective**: Finalize implementation and handoff.
**Status**: Code Complete. Deployment pending user action.

## # Actions Taken
1. **Verified Supabase Status**: 
   - Checked `https://gvybvfbnqgzcisuchocz.supabase.co`
   - Result: **404 Not Found**. Project is confirmed paused or deleted.
   
2. **Created Master Deployment Script**:
   - `finish_deployment.sh`: Automates Vercel install, deployment, and verification.
   
3. **Created Recovery Documentation**:
   - `docs/SUPABASE_FRESH_SETUP.md`: Step-by-step guide to create a new DB and get the correct pooler URL.
   - `docs/VERCEL_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`: Detailed frontend deployment instructions.
   - `FINAL_REPORT.md`: High-level summary of the project status.

## # Current State
- **Backend**: Deployed on Render (waiting for valid DB connection).
- **Frontend**: Ready to deploy (waiting for Vercel login).
- **Database**: Offline (User needs to restore/recreate).

## # Next Steps (For User)
1. Restore Supabase project (or create new one).
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and Render.
3. Run `./finish_deployment.sh`.

## # Next Steps (For LLM)
- If user returns saying "I fixed the database", ask for the new connection string.
- If user says "Script failed", ask for the error log.
- Otherwise, the project is **Done**.
